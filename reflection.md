If i could restart I would have done collision detection first because I really underestimated how hard it is to do it, in the past week I have literally spent 10 hours trying everything and have only gotten increasingly angrier over time, If this had been done way earlier on I would've have been able to submit a much much much much better version of the game but instead im stuck with something that no one would play, It was by far the hardest part and truly made me want to light my computer on fire and beat my moniter until it was unusable, My needs to have list had to change alot throughout building this but besides the collision detection I think that everything looks great and if I could have gotten that 1 thing done it would be 10000000 times better then it is now, im sorry to hand it in this way but I did try very hard sadly though the outcome was not in my favour at all.

for my beta testing I never got anyone in the class but I did implement stuff my friend said too i.e adding a good menu, telling you the controls and of course collision detection but at this point its clear that that did not happen
