# Major Project Proposal :)

## Description
A platformer involving Lil Uzi Vert who will be the playable character, the enemies will be his demons as he is known for being sad.
Upon beating a level you will recieve 1.5 million dollars and your character will grow 1 inch (he starts out at 5'4),
there will be 12 levels because in his song Sanguine Paradise he says "in reality i'm 5'4 stand on my money now im 6'6".
So at the end of the game you will be 6'6 and have 18 million dollars which is Lil Uzi Vert's net worth.

## Need To Have List
1. Every level will be based around a Lil Uzi Song (going from his first project to his newer stuff, more of the newer because it is more popular and honestly better) and you'll have to beat it before the song ends.
2. Good graphics (for the background, more or less everything that isnt a character)
3. Non laggy characters so hopefully somewhat seamless moving
## Nice To Have List
1. Everytime you beat a level you get a new chain which will give you a bonus attribute i.e speed, more attack damage, double jump.
2. Have hidden rooms with clothes that do nothing but add customizability to your character.
3. Have bonus levels where you play as other rappers (A$AP ROCKY, Playboi Carto, Tyler The Creator)
4. Have a final boss (probably satan)
